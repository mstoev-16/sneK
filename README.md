This is a simple game where you play as an alien that collects apples and tries to escape from the knights which are patrolling the area.


## How to start the game

After downloading the files in a folder of your choice run the *'.py'* file. 

## How the game works
The goal of the game is to collect apples and achive a high score. Beware of the knights because if one of them catches you, it is game over. There are a total of 5 knights and the first one spawns from the start of the game. The rest will spawn one after another each time 3 apples are collected. After that, on every 5th apple, the speed at which the knights move is increased so you have to be careful. Each knight moves in only one direction. Check the *'Knights order and directions'* section, to the movements of the knights and in what order they spawn.

In the bottom of the screen there are 3 score indicator - your current score, your all time best score, and your score from the last game. Everytime you are caught by a knight or you close the game, your score is saved. If you wish to reset it, simply open the   *'score_records.json'* file and set the values to '0'.

- Navigate the player by using the arrow keys.
